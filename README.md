🌟 AI Supporting Personalized Mental Health Care 🌟

🧠 Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

This project aims to create personalized mental health support powered by artificial intelligence. AI will provide mood tracking, stress management tools, and tailored daily mindfulness exercises, delivering real-time support. 🧘‍♀️✨

## Background

🩺 Mental health issues are increasingly common in today’s fast-paced world. 🌍 Millions of people struggle with stress, anxiety, and depression. 😟 Often, they cannot access help due to stigma, high costs, or lack of resources. This project seeks to bridge this gap by creating an AI-based tool that allows users to manage their mental health in a private and affordable way.

💡 Key motivations:

- Over 264 million people 🌎 suffer from depression (WHO data).
- Stigma 😔 and the shortage of mental health professionals make traditional therapy inaccessible for many (also due to the high cost of private specialists).
- Personalized and proactive solutions can significantly improve mental health outcomes. 

## How it works?

🤔 The AI will be available as a mobile app with the following key functionalities:

1. **Mood tracking:** Users log their emotions daily through text or voice. 🎙️ AI analyzes patterns and provides feedback. 🔄
2. **Stress management tools:** 🧘‍♂️ Offers breathing exercises, guided meditations 🎧, and calming music based on the user’s input and emotions.
3. **Customized recommendations:** Based on the user’s mood history and preferences, the app suggests activities such as mindfulness exercises 🌿 or journaling prompts. 
4. **Real-time crisis support:** Connects users to mental health hotlines when critical stress levels are detected, enabling them to speak to professionals for help.

The app targets adults aged 18 and above, especially those with mild to moderate mental health challenges. 😊 Its user-friendly interface ensures accessibility even for less tech-savvy individuals. For those with more severe mental health issues, seeking professional help from specialists is strongly recommended. 🩺

## Data Sources and AI Methods

### 📊 Data sources:

- Public datasets: [AffectNet](http://www.affectnet.org) 🌐 for emotion recognition.
- User-generated data: Anonymous user inputs (mood logs, app interactions, user music choices, etc.).

### 🤖 AI Techniques:

- Natural Language Processing (NLP): 📖 To analyze users’ text or spoken mood journals.
- Sentiment analysis: 💭 Identifying emotional patterns over time.
- Machine learning: 📈 Personalizing recommendations based on user history and preferences.
- Computer vision (optional): 👁️ Recognizing emotions based on facial expressions (if users opt for camera-based tracking 📷).

## Challenges

1. **Data privacy:** 🔒 Ensuring user data is securely stored and anonymized to protect sensitive information. 🛡️
2. **Ethical issues:** ⚖️ Avoiding over-reliance on AI for serious mental health problems and clearly communicating that the app does not replace professional help. 🙅‍♂️
3. **Bias in AI models:** ⚙️ Preventing biases in emotion recognition models stemming from limitations in training data.
4. **Accessibility:** 🌐 Making the app useful for diverse demographics and technological skill levels. 

## What’s next?
